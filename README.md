## HOW TO USE
Open it on unity 2017.3 or greater (sorry about that >-< ), and play around with the project

## HOW TO Integrate Multiplayer System/Server
We need an account on Photon to configure our game .Go to https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/Photon. Log in to your account if you already have otherwise you can click on Register to create new account.

Step-2 : Provide necessary info related to your game and create game.

Step-3 : Get your App Id from dashboard

# Manage connection with Photon
Create a new script called PUNManager and add it to an empty gameobject. Using this script we will handle all server side operations. First of all, we need to connect with Photon. This will enable us to host and join rooms of our game based on the AppID. Call PhotonNetwork.ConnectUsingSettings () method to make connection. We can pass the version number of the game as a string in the argument.
